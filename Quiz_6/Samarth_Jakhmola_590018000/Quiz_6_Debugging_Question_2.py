# 1. Identify the bug in the stack condition:
# The issue is in this line:
# while stack and prices[stack[-1]] >= prices[i]:
# This should check for less than or equal to maintain the stock span logic.

# 2. Explain what the current logic does incorrectly:
# The current logic pops elements with prices *greater than or equal to* the current price.
# But we actually want to remove *only those that are less than or equal* to the current price.
# As a result, it skips valid spans when prices are smaller but not popped due to the incorrect comparison,
# leading to incorrect span values.

# 3. What should the correct condition be?
# Correct the condition to:
# while stack and prices[stack[-1]] <= prices[i]:
# This ensures we remove all previous smaller/equal prices to compute the correct span.
