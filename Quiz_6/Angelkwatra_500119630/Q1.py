#1. Identify the bug in the stack condition:
# while stack and prices[stack[-1]] >= prices[i]:

# 2. Why this causes incorrect behavior:
# The logic pops larger or equal prices, but stock span should count all previous prices that are smaller or equal to current.
# By removing higher prices, we lose the history of spans that shouldâ€™ve been counted.
