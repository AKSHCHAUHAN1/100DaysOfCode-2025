//answer 1.Bug Location:
//The bug is in the pop() method
//push() has a logical flaw due to being state-dependent only
//Bug Effect:min_val becomes incorrect when the current minimum is popped.
//answer 2. Why this causes incorrect behavior:The class tracks only one min_val at any given time.
//When you pop() the minimum element, it does not recalculate the new minimum from the remaining elements in the stack.
//As a result, get_min() still returns the old (now invalid) minimum.
//correct code--
  class MinStack:
    def _init_(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.min_stack = []

    def push(self, val):
        self.stack.append(val)
        # Push to min_stack if it's the new minimum
        if not self.min_stack or val <= self.min_stack[-1]:
            self.min_stack.append(val)

    def pop(self):
        if self.stack:
            popped = self.stack.pop()
            if popped == self.min_stack[-1]:
                self.min_stack.pop()
            return popped

    def get_min(self):
        return self.min_stack[-1] if self.min_stack else None
