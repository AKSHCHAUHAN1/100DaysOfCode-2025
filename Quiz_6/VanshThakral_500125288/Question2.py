 # Error 
# while stack and prices[stack[-1]] >= prices[i]:

# üîç What's wrong?
# The condition is removing prices greater than or equal to the current price.
# But in the stock span problem, we should remove prices that are less than or equal, 
# because we want to count all previous smaller or equal values.
# So you're popping useful values that should be included in the span calculation.
