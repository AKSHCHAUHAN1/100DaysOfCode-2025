#line 6 is having bug in while stack and prices[stack[-1]] >= prices[i]: this code
#in the code of buggy line 6, the current logic was popping when previous price was greater than or equal â€” which removed valid span contributors.
#the correct condition should be while stack and prices[stack[-1]] <= prices[i]:
