1. Identify the specific line(s) causing the bug:
if (n & (n - 1)) == 0: 
 This is Correct logic for positive integers only, But this line doesn't take care for negative numbers that's the issue.
So, the bug is:
Missing a check to ensure n is a positive number greater than zero.

2. Why this causes incorrect behavior:
The current function checks if a number is a power of two using the formula (n & (n - 1)) == 0,
which works well only for positive numbers. However, it doesn't prevent negative numbers from being tested.
In Python (and most programming languages),negative numbers are represented using twoâ€™s complement binary,
which causes the bitwise operation to behave unexpectedly. 
As a result, some negative numbers can accidentally pass the condition (n & (n - 1)) == 0, even though they are not powers of two.
So when the input is -2 or -8, the function wrongly prints "YES", which is incorrect.
To fix this, we need to make sure we only check the formula for positive integers greater than 0.

Here I am also attaching fixed code:
def is_power_of_two(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    return (n & (n - 1)) == 0
