# 1. Identify the specific line(s) causing the bug:
# -- if (n & (n - 1)) == 0:
# 2. Why this causes incorrect behavior:
# -- The logic (n & (n - 1)) == 0 works for any number that has only one bit set â€” which is a defining property of powers of 2.
# --But in two's complement representation, negative numbers can also satisfy this condition due to how bits behave.
# -- So in some cases, especially with small negative values, this condition might misleadingly evaluate to True.
