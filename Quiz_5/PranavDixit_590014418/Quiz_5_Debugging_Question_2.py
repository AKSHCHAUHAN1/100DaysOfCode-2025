Debugging Report â€“ Bit Manipulation Problem
-------------------------------------------

Task 1: Identify the Bug
------------------------
The main issue is in this line:

    if num & xor_sum:

This line is supposed to split the numbers into two groups based on a differing bit between the two unique elements.
But using `xor_sum` here is incorrect because it checks multiple bits instead of just one.

What we should be using instead is:

    if num & diff_bit:

This `diff_bit` is calculated using `xor_sum & -xor_sum` and gives us the rightmost set bit.
That single bit is enough to differentiate the two unique numbers and separate the rest correctly.

Task 2: Why This Causes Incorrect Behavior
------------------------------------------
Here's why using `xor_sum` directly breaks the logic:

- `xor_sum` is the XOR of the two unique numbers. It gives us a result where the bits that differ between the two numbers are set.
- But if we try to split the numbers based on `xor_sum`, we might be checking multiple bits at once, which causes numbers that should cancel out to end up in the wrong group.
- Instead, using just one specific bit (`diff_bit`) makes sure we divide all numbers into two correct groups where duplicates cancel each other, and the two unique numbers remain in the end.

Hope that makes sense!
