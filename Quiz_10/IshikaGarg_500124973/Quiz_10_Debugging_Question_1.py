1.
The bug is in this line of code:

activities.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

This line sorts the activities based on their start time (x[0]).

The correct greedy approach for the Activity Selection problem requires sorting the activities based on their finish time, 
not their start time. The correct sorting criterion should be:

activities.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

2. Why this causes suboptimal results
The core principle of the greedy algorithm for Activity Selection is to always select the activity that finishes earliest among all non-overlapping activities. 
The reason for this choice is that by finishing as early as possible, you leave the maximum amount of time available for subsequent activities. 
This increases the chances of fitting more activities into the remaining schedule.


Corrected code:
def activity_selection(start, end):
    n = len(start)
    activities = []

    # Combine start and end times into a list of tuples
    for i in range(n):
        activities.append((start[i], end[i]))

    # CRITICAL FIX: Sort activities by their finish time (the second element of the tuple)
    activities.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

    # If there are no activities, return 0
    if not activities:
        return 0
    
    # Select the first activity from the sorted list
    selected = [activities[0]]
    last_end = activities[0][1]

    # Iterate through the remaining activities
    for i in range(1, n):
        current_start = activities[i][0]
        current_end = activities[i][1]
        
        # If the current activity's start time is greater than or equal to the
        # finish time of the last selected activity, select it.
        if current_start >= last_end:
            selected.append(activities[i])
            last_end = current_end

    return len(selected)

# Test case:
start = [1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5]
end = [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9]
result = activity_selection(start, end)
print(f"Maximum activities: {result}")
