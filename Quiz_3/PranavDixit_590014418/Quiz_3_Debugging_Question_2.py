    # Task 1: Bug Found
    # The mistake was in the part where we were handling 2s (blue).
    # After swapping with right, the code was increasing current, which skipped checking the new value.

    # Task 2: Why it gave wrong results
    # When we swap, the value at 'current' changes â€” but if we increment current,
    # we miss checking it, which breaks the logic.

    # Task 3: Final working solution
