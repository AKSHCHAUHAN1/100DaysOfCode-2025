 # Specific Indexing Bug Inside the nested loop:
 # if text1[i] == text2[j]:
 # Bug: i and j range from 1 to m/n, but Python strings are 0-indexed.
 # Fix: Use i-1 and j-1:
 # if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:
 # Why?

# The DP table dp has dimensions (m+1) x (n+1) to handle the base case (empty prefix).
# The loop starts at 1 so that dp[i][j] represents the LCS of text1[0:i] and text2[0:j].
# Using text1[i] and text2[j] shifts every comparison one character ahead, causing:
# IndexError if i == m or j == n (last iteration tries to access a non-existent character).
# Even if it doesnâ€™t crash (due to certain lengths), it compares the wrong characters, producing incorrect LCS lengths.
