# 1. Identify the indexing bug in array access 
# -- You're accessing weights[i] and values[i], but weights and values are 0-indexed, while i starts from 1. So weights[i] refers to the (i+1)th item, which is incorrect and will eventually go out of bounds when i == n.

# 2. Explain what happens when the function tries to access out-of-bounds indices
# -- When i == n (i.e., the last iteration), weights[i] and values[i] attempt to access weights[n] and values[n], which do not exist. This causes:
# IndexError in strict environments.
# Or worse: silent logic errors, where the wrong item is used or skipped, leading to incorrect results.

# 3. What should be the correct indexing for weights and values arrays?
