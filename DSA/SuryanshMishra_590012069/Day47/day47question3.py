# 3. Find the Front and Rear of the Queue
# A diagnostic operation to retrieve boundary elements of a queue without altering it â€” useful for monitoring, status checks, and queue visualization.

# Write a function that returns the front and rear elements of a queue without modifying it. If the queue is empty, return an appropriate message.

# This teaches non-destructive access, queue boundary analysis, and helps in queue status validation in various applications.

# Your task: Retrieve the front and rear of the queue or return an empty message.

# Examples
# Input:

# Queue = [10, 20, 30]
# Output:

# Front: 10, Rear: 30
# Input:

# Queue = []
# Output:

# Queue is empty
