1. Three Sum Problem
A problem that introduces multi-pointer optimization techniques and teaches triplet finding
algorithms using sorted array traversal methods for advanced sum-based analysis and
combinatorial operations.
Find all triplets in an array that sum up to a given target (e.g., 0) using three-pointer
technique with duplicate handling. This operation is fundamental in combinatorial
optimization and multi-element analysis where you need to find complex
relationships between multiple array elements efficiently. The technique uses sorted array
traversal with fixed first element and two-pointer search for remaining pairs, avoiding
duplicate triplets through careful advancement. This concept is essential in algorithmic
problem solving, financial analysis, and optimization problems where finding multi-
element combinations that meet specific criteria enables complex decision making and
relationship analysis.
This teaches multi-pointer algorithms and combinatorial optimization techniques that are
essential for triplet finding and efficient multi-element relationship analysis operations.
Your task: Implement three-pointer technique with duplicate avoidance to find all unique
triplets meeting target sum criteria efficiently.

2. Container With Most Water
A problem that demonstrates geometric optimization techniques and teaches area
maximization algorithms using two-pointer convergence methods for spatial analysis and
optimization problems.
Given n non-negative integers representing height, find two lines that together with the x-
axis form a container that holds the most water using two-pointer optimization. This
operation is fundamental in geometric optimization and area maximization where you need
to find optimal boundaries that maximize enclosed space efficiently. The technique
uses two-pointer convergence from array ends, moving the shorter line inward to explore
potentially larger areas. This concept is essential in engineering design, resource
optimization, and spatial analysis where maximizing container capacity enables efficient
storage planning and geometric optimization.
This introduces geometric optimization algorithms and area maximization
techniques that are crucial for spatial analysis and efficient container optimization
operations.
Your task: Implement two-pointer convergence with height-based movement strategy to find
maximum water container area through optimal boundary selection.
Examples
Input:

3. Subarrays with Product Less than K
A problem that teaches sliding window with multiplicative constraints and demonstrates
product-based counting algorithms using variable window techniques for threshold-based
subarray analysis.
Given an array and k, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of
elements is less than k using sliding window approach. This operation is fundamental
in multiplicative analysis and constraint counting where you need to count valid
segments meeting product thresholds efficiently. The technique uses variable sliding
window with product tracking and window contraction when exceeding limits, counting all
valid subarrays ending at each position. This concept is essential in quality
control, performance analysis, and threshold monitoring where counting segments
meeting multiplicative criteria enables statistical analysis and process validation.
This teaches multiplicative constraint algorithms and sliding window counting
techniques that are essential for product-based analysis and efficient subarray
enumeration operations.
Your task: Implement sliding window with product constraint tracking to count all valid
subarrays meeting multiplicative threshold requirements efficiently.
