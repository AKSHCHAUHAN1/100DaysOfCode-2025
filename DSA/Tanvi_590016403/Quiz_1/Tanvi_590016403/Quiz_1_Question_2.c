. Identify the bug in the above implementation

In the original code:

int findMax(int arr[], int n)
{
    int max;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        if (arr[i] > max)
        {
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return max;
}
The bug is that the variable max is declared but not initialized. Using an uninitialized variable in a comparison (arr[i] > max) results in undefined behavior. It may contain a garbage value, leading to incorrect results.

2. What kind of incorrect behavior or result might it produce?

Because max is uninitialized, the comparison may incorrectly fail, and the function might:

Return a random garbage value
Skip updating max entirely
Fail to identify the correct maximum element
This can result in unpredictable or wrong outputs during runtime.

3. Rewrite the corrected version of the function

int findMax(int arr[], int n)
{
    int max = arr[0]; // Initialize max with the first element
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
    {
        if (arr[i] > max)
        {
            max = arr[i];
        }
    }
    return max;
}
Explanation of Fix:

We initialize max to arr[0], the first element in the array.
Start the loop from i = 1 since arr[0] is already considered.
This ensures we compare only valid values and correctly track the maximum.
