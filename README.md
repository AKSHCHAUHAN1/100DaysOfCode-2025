## 1. Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
A problem that introduces sliding window optimization techniques and teaches fixed-size subarray analysis using efficient window-based computation methods for array processing and optimization.

Given an array and a number **k**, find the **maximum sum** of a subarray of size **k** using a sliding window approach.

## 3. Subarray with Given Sum
A problem that teaches variable-size sliding window techniques and demonstrates dynamic window adjustment algorithms for target sum finding using efficient pointer-based traversal methods.

Given an array of **non-negative integers** and a **target sum**, find the subarray with the given sum using **sliding window technique**. This operation is fundamental in **subarray analysis** and **target finding** where you need to **locate specific sum ranges** within arrays efficiently. The technique uses **variable-size sliding window** with two pointers that expand and contract dynamically to match the target sum. This concept is essential in **financial analysis**, **resource allocation**, and **optimization problems** where finding segments that meet specific criteria enables decision making and resource planning in array-based data structures.
