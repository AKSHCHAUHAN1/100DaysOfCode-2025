## 1. Linear Search

A problem that introduces fundamental search algorithms and teaches sequential data traversal techniques.



Write a function that searches for a specific **target element** in an array and returns its **index position**. Use the **linear search method**, which means checking each element one by one from the beginning until you find the target or reach the end of the array. If the target element is found, return its index (starting from 0). If the element is not present in the array, **return -1** to indicate that the search was unsuccessful.



This teaches **sequential search algorithms** and **array traversal techniques** that form the foundation of **search operations in computer science**.



**Your task:** Implement linear search to find target element's index position.



### Examples



**Input:**

```

Array: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], Target: 30

```

**Output:**

```

2

```

**Input:**

```

Array: [1, 5, 9, 3, 7], Target: 8

```

**Output:**

```

-1

```

**Input:**

```

Array: [15, 25, 35, 45], Target: 25

```

**Output:**

```

1

```

## 2. Count Occurrences

A problem that demonstrates frequency analysis and counting techniques essential for data analysis and statistics.



Given an array of integers and a **target number**, write a program that counts how many times the target number appears in the array. This is useful for **data analysis** where you need to find the **frequency of specific values**. Your program should traverse through the entire array and maintain a **counter** that increments each time the target value is encountered.



This teaches **frequency counting algorithms** and **statistical analysis techniques** commonly used in **data processing and pattern recognition**.



**Your task:** Count the frequency of a target value in an array.



### Examples



**Input:**

```

Array: [1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4], Target: 2

```

**Output:**

```

3

```

**Input:**

```

Array: [5, 1, 5, 5, 3, 5, 7], Target: 5

```

**Output:**

```

4

```



---



**Input:**

```

Array: [10, 20, 30, 10, 40], Target: 10

```

**Output:**

```

2

```

## 3. Find Maximum Element

A problem that teaches fundamental optimization algorithms and demonstrates how to track extreme values efficiently.



Create a function that finds and returns the **largest element** in an unsorted array of integers. Your algorithm should examine each element in the array and **keep track of the maximum value** seen so far. This is a fundamental operation in **data processing** and forms the basis for many other algorithms. The function should work efficiently even with **negative numbers** in the array.



This introduces **optimization algorithms** and **comparison-based searching** techniques that are essential in **algorithm design and data analysis**.



**Your task:** Find the maximum element in an array using single-pass traversal.



### Examples



**Input:**

```

[3, 7, 1, 9, 4, 6]

```

**Output:**

```

9

```



---



**Input:**

```

[-5, -2, -8, -1, -3]

```

**Output:**

```

-1

```



---



**Input:**

```

[100, 250, 75, 300, 150]

```

**Output:**

```

300

```
