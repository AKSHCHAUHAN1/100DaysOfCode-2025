Tasks:

1. Identify the specific line(s) causing the bug 
if queue.pop(0) != stack.pop():
This line causing the main problem,it’s actually removing elements from the original queue, which we didn’t want.
we wanted to just check if it’s a palindrome without changing the original data.

Also, at the end of the function, there was this line: return len(queue) == len(stack)
But this also becomes pointless, because both queue and stack might already be empty or messed up due to previous pops.

2. Why this causes incorrect behavior:
Using pop(0) on the original queue actually deletes items from it.

That’s why after running the function, if we print the original queue, it’s no longer the same.

This makes the function destructive, and that’s not what we wanted.
