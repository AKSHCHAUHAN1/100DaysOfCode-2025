Tasks:

1. Identify the specific line(s) causing the bug 
Actually, there is no single wrong line in the code, the logic itself is also not completely correct!
Here is the code:
while q1 or q2:
    if q1:
        result.append(q1.popleft())
    if q2:
        result.append(q2.popleft())
      
  2. Why this causes incorrect behavior:
The function keeps taking from q1 first, then from q2.

If both queues have elements, it looks like they're added in turns.

But when one queue becomes empty, the other one keeps adding without any alternation.
  
After one queue is empty, it keeps adding from the other queue directly without turn-by-turn pattern,So technically, itâ€™s not really alternating anymore once one queue finishes.
