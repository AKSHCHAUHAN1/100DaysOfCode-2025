1. Identify the specific line(s) causing the bug:
No syntax error, but the logical error is in how alternation is interpreted:

    while q1 or q2:
        if q1:
            result.append(q1.popleft())
        if q2:
            result.append(q2.popleft())
This code appends from q1 and then from q2 in each iteration, if they are non-empty.
But this does not guarantee strict alternation if one queue is longer than the other.

2. Why this causes incorrect behavior:
The current implementation does not truly alternate.

It simply tries to get one from each in every loop, but doesn't maintain turn-based logic.

For queues like:
q1 = deque([1, 3, 5, 7])
q2 = deque([2])
The output will be: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7] â€” this might look fine, but strict alternation would mean:

1 from q1
2 from q2
then q2 is empty, but q1 continues
That may be acceptable for simple interleaving, but if a requirement is strict alternation, we need to switch turns even if one is exhausted.


correct code:

def merge_queues_alternately(q1, q2):
    result = deque()
    turn = 0  # 0 for q1, 1 for q2

    while q1 or q2:
        if turn == 0 and q1:
            result.append(q1.popleft())
        elif turn == 1 and q2:
            result.append(q2.popleft())
        # Alternate turn
        turn = 1 - turn

    return result
