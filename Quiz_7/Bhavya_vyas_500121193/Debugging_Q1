 Tasks:
1. Identify the specific line(s) causing the bug:

Line 11: queue.pop(0)
→ This modifies the original queue.

2. Why this causes incorrect behavior:

The function modifies the original queue, which is unexpected in a checker function.
After checking, queue is mutated, so it's no longer usable (see test_queue output).
Also, the final line return len(queue) == len(stack) is unnecessary and misleading — lengths will always match at that point or already returned.
