# 1.  The specific lines with the bug are - 
# while q1 or q2:
#     if q1 or q2:
#         result.append(q1.popleft())
#     if q2:
#         result.append(q2.popleft())
# It is so because they do not ensure strict alternation once one of the queues becomes empty. This can lead to unequal merging,especially
# if the lengths of q1 and q2 differ. However, in this specific implementation there is no bug in the output for the given use case.
# The original implementation merges the remaining elements after one queue is exhausted, which might actuallybe the intended behavoiur in
# some interpretations.
 
# 2.  If strict alternation is required, this code fails because it continues to merge remaining elements from the longer queue. In such a
# case, the logic should stop once either q1 or q2 becomes empty.
