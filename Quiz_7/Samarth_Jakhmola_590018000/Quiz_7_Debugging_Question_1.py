# 1.  The line with the bug is - 
# if queue.pop() != stack.pop():
# This loop is directly modifying the original 'queue' using pop(0), which removes elements from the front of the original queue.
# This leads to the original queue being altered during the check, which is not desired.

# 2.  Modifying the original queue causes the original data to be lost. After the palindrome check, the original queue is no longer intact,
# which violates the expectation that such a check should be non - destructive. Moreover, the final return statement - 
# return len(queue) == len(stack) - will always return True if both queues are empty, even if the palindrome was not a palindrome, because
# they were both emptied during comparison. This makes incorrect results and leads to false positives in some cases.
