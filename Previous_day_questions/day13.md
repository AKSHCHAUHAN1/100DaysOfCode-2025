## 1. Word Count
A problem that teaches text parsing and analysis techniques commonly used in document processing applications.

Write a program that **counts the number of words** in a given string. Words are separated by one or more spaces, and you should handle **leading and trailing spaces** properly. Additionally, find the **longest word** in the string and return both the word count and the longest word.

This is useful for **text analysis and document processing applications** and helps understand **string tokenization and parsing techniques**.

**Your task:** Count words and find the longest word while handling whitespace properly.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
"Hello world programming"
```
**Output:**
```
Word count: 3, Longest word: "programming"
```

---

**Input:**
```
" Java Python C++ "
```
**Output:**
```
Word count: 3, Longest word: "Python"
```

---

**Input:**
```
"a bb ccc dddd"
```
**Output:**
```
Word count: 4, Longest word: "dddd"
```

## 2. Palindrome Permutation
A problem that combines character frequency analysis with palindrome properties for advanced text processing.

Given a string, determine if any **permutation (rearrangement)** of the string can form a palindrome. You don't need to generate the palindrome, just check if it's possible. For a string to form a palindrome, **at most one character can have an odd frequency**.

This problem combines **character frequency analysis with palindrome properties** and teaches important concepts used in **combinatorial string algorithms**.

**Your task:** Check if any permutation of a string can form a palindrome.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
"aab"
```
**Output:**
```
true
```

---

**Input:**
```
"abc"
```
**Output:**
```
false
```

---

**Input:**
```
"aabbcc"
```
**Output:**
```
true
```

## 3. Reverse Words in String
A problem that combines string parsing with array manipulation for text processing applications.

Given a string containing multiple words separated by spaces, **reverse the order of the words** but keep each word intact. For example, "Hello World Programming" should become "Programming World Hello". Handle multiple spaces between words by **preserving single spaces** in the output.

This problem combines **string parsing with array/list manipulation** and demonstrates techniques used in **text formatting and document processing**.

**Your task:** Reverse word order while maintaining word integrity and proper spacing.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
"Hello World Programming"
```
**Output:**
```
"Programming World Hello"
```

---

**Input:**
```
"The quick brown fox"
```
**Output:**
```
"fox brown quick The"
```

---

**Input:**
```
"Java Python C++"
```
**Output:**
```
"C++ Python Java"
```
