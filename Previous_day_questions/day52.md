## 1. Check Array for Pair with Sum
A problem that introduces two-pointer optimization techniques and teaches efficient pair finding algorithms using sorted array properties for target sum detection and array analysis operations.

Given a sorted array and a number **x**, check if there exists a **pair of elements** whose **sum is exactly x** using two-pointer technique.
