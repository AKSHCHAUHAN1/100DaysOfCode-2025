## 1. Add 1 to an Integer Using Bitwise
A problem that introduces advanced arithmetic simulation using bitwise operations and teaches how to perform addition without traditional arithmetic operators.

Add **1** to an integer **n** using only **bitwise operators** (no + or -). This problem demonstrates how fundamental arithmetic operations can be implemented using bit manipulation and is commonly used in **low-level programming** and **embedded systems** where arithmetic operations might be restricted or need optimization. The challenge involves understanding how binary addition works at the bit level, including handling carry propagation through multiple bit positions.

This teaches **bitwise arithmetic simulation** and **carry propagation techniques** that are essential for **low-level programming and efficient arithmetic implementations**.

## 2. Subtract 1 from an Integer Using Bitwise
A problem that demonstrates subtraction simulation using bitwise operations and teaches how to perform decrement operations without traditional arithmetic operators.

Subtract **1** from a given number **n** using only **bitwise operations**, without using the subtraction operator. This operation is fundamental in **bit manipulation** and **low-level programming** where you need to **implement arithmetic operations** using only logical operations. The challenge involves understanding how binary subtraction works, including handling borrow operations when subtracting from numbers with trailing zeros.

This introduces **bitwise subtraction simulation** and **borrow handling techniques** that are crucial for **arithmetic operation implementation and low-level mathematical computations**.

## 3. Check if Binary Representation of a Number is Palindrome
A problem that teaches binary pattern analysis and demonstrates how to check symmetry in binary representations using bit manipulation techniques.

Given a number **n**, check whether its **binary representation is a palindrome** (i.e., reads the same forwards and backwards). This problem combines **bit manipulation** with **palindrome detection** and is commonly used in **digital signal processing** and **pattern recognition** where you need to **analyze binary symmetry**. The challenge involves efficiently comparing bits from both ends of the binary representation without converting to strings.

This teaches **binary symmetry detection** and **bit-level palindrome checking** techniques that are essential for **pattern recognition and efficient binary data analysis**.

**Your task:** Check if a number's binary representation is palindromic using efficient bit manipulation without string conversion.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
n = 9 (binary: 1001)
```
**Output:**
```
Yes
```

**Input:**
```
n = 10 (binary: 1010)
```
**Output:**
```
