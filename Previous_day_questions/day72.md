## 1. Mirror of Binary Tree
A problem that demonstrates tree transformation techniques and teaches structural modification algorithms using recursive reflection for efficient binary tree mirroring and symmetrical conversion operations.

Given a **binary tree**, convert it to its **mirror image** by swapping left and right subtrees at every node using recursive transformation strategy. This operation is fundamental in **tree manipulation** and **structural modification** where you need to **create symmetric representations** for reflection-based operations efficiently. The technique uses **recursive subtree swapping** by exchanging left and right children at each node, then recursively applying the same transformation to all subtrees. This concept is essential in **image processing**, **geometric transformations**, and **data visualization** where creating mirror representations enables symmetrical analysis and optimal visual presentation in reflection-based computational systems.

This demonstrates **tree transformation algorithms** and **recursive modification techniques** that are crucial for **structural manipulation and efficient symmetrical conversion operations**.

**Your task:** Implement recursive tree mirroring using subtree swapping to transform binary tree into its symmetric reflection with preserved node values.

**Input Tree:**
```
    1
   / \
  2   3

## 2. Check if Two Trees are Identical
A problem that introduces tree comparison analysis and teaches structural equality algorithms using recursive validation for efficient binary tree matching and similarity verification operations.

Given **two binary trees**, check if they are **identical in structure and node values** using recursive comparison validation strategy. This operation is fundamental in **tree comparison** and **structural validation** where you need to **verify complete equality** across hierarchical data structures efficiently. The technique uses **recursive node-by-node comparison** checking both value equality and structural similarity at each level, ensuring corresponding nodes exist with matching values in both trees. This concept is essential in **data validation**, **version control**, and **backup verification** where confirming structural integrity enables reliable data management and optimal consistency checking in tree-based storage systems.

This introduces **tree comparison algorithms** and **equality validation techniques** that are essential for **structural verification and efficient similarity checking operations**.

**Your task:** Implement recursive tree comparison using node-by-node validation to verify complete structural and value equality between two binary trees.

## 3. Count Nodes in Binary Tree
A problem that teaches tree size measurement and demonstrates recursive counting algorithms using complete traversal for efficient binary tree node enumeration and size determination operations.

Given a **binary tree**, count the **total number of nodes** in the tree using recursive enumeration approach. This operation is fundamental in **tree analysis** and **size measurement** where you need to **determine structure capacity** for memory and performance assessment efficiently. The technique uses **recursive node counting** by adding one for current node plus counts from left and right subtrees, ensuring complete tree traversal for accurate enumeration. This concept is essential in **memory management**, **performance analysis**, and **resource allocation** where understanding tree size enables efficient algorithm selection and optimal memory utilization in node-based hierarchical systems.
