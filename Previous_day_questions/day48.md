## 1. Remove All Occurrences of an Element from a Queue
A problem that demonstrates selective queue modification techniques and teaches element filtering operations using conditional removal algorithms for data cleaning and queue purification processes.

Given a queue of integers and an integer **x**, remove **all occurrences** of **x** from the queue and return the updated queue. This operation is fundamental in **data filtering** and **queue cleaning** where you need to **eliminate specific values** while preserving the order of remaining elements. The technique requires understanding **conditional traversal** methods that selectively retain or discard elements based on matching criteria. This concept is essential in **data preprocessing**, **noise removal**, and **stream filtering** where removing unwanted values improves data quality and enables focused processing of relevant information.

This teaches **selective filtering algorithms** and **conditional queue modification techniques** that are essential for **data cleaning and efficient element removal operations**.

**Your task:** Implement conditional queue traversal with selective element retention to remove all instances of the target value while preserving queue order.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
Queue = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4], x = 2
```
**Output:**
```
[1, 3, 4]
```

**Input:**
```
Queue = [5, 5, 5], x = 5
```
**Output:**

## 2. Check if All Elements in Queue are Unique
A problem that introduces uniqueness validation techniques and teaches duplicate detection algorithms using efficient comparison methods for data integrity verification in queue structures.

Given a queue of integers, determine whether **all elements are unique** (no duplicates) and return **True or False**. This operation is fundamental in **data validation** and **integrity checking** where you need to **verify element uniqueness** within queue datasets. The technique involves understanding **duplicate detection** methods that can use hash-based tracking or comparative analysis to identify repeated values efficiently. This concept is essential in **database operations**, **set validation**, and **data quality assurance** where uniqueness constraints ensure data consistency and prevent duplicate processing in queue-based systems.

This introduces **uniqueness validation algorithms** and **duplicate detection techniques** that are crucial for **data integrity verification and efficient uniqueness checking operations**.

**Your task:** Implement efficient duplicate detection using appropriate data structures to verify complete element uniqueness across the entire queue.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```
**Output:**
```
True
```

---

**Input:**
```
[1, 2, 2, 3]
```
**Output:**
```
False
```

## 3. Count Occurrences of Each Element in a Queue
A problem that teaches frequency analysis techniques and demonstrates element counting algorithms using hash-based tracking methods for statistical analysis and data profiling operations.

Given a queue of integers, count the **occurrences of each element** and return the frequency distribution as a dictionary or mapping structure. This operation is fundamental in **statistical analysis** and **data profiling** where you need to **analyze element frequencies** within queue datasets. The technique requires understanding **frequency counting** methods that track element occurrences efficiently using hash-based storage. This concept is essential in **data mining**, **pattern analysis**, and **statistical computing** where frequency distributions provide insights into data patterns and enable further analytical processing on queue-based information.

This teaches **frequency analysis algorithms** and **statistical counting techniques** that are essential for **data profiling and efficient element frequency tracking operations**.

**Your task:** Implement hash-based frequency counting to analyze element occurrences and generate comprehensive frequency distribution from queue data.

### Examples

**Input:**
```
[1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1]
```
**Output:**
```
{1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1}
```

---

**Input:**
```
[5, 5, 7, 8, 7]
```
**Output:**
```
{5: 2, 7: 2, 8: 1}
```
